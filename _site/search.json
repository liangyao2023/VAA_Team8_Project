    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nIllegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing refers to fishing activities that are conducted in violation of both national and international fishing regulations (NOAA Fisheries, n.d.). Such fishing activities pose a significant threat to marine biodiversity, and sustainable fisheries. It undermines conservation efforts, leads to overfishing, and negatively impacts the livelihoods of fishing communities.\nTo identify companies who are potentially engaged in such unscrupulous activities, the country of Oceanus has enlisted the help of FishEye International. Using incomplete import and export data of Oceanus’ marine and fishing industries, Fisheye was able to generate a knowledge graph, in the hopes of uncovering business relationships and patterns that can aid in the detection of IUU fisheries. While node-link diagrams offered a useful overview of the knowledge graph at a high level, this study aims to create visualizations that offer more detailed insights into patterns involving entities within the knowledge graph.\n\n\nObjectives\nWith reference to Mini Challenge 2 of the VAST Challenge 2023, we aim to build an interactive Shiny app in order to answer the following questions:\n\nUse visual analytics to identify temporal patterns for individual entities and between entities in the knowledge graph FishEye created from trade records. Categorize the types of business relationship patterns you find. Limit your response to 600 words and 6 images.\nEvaluate the sets of predicted knowledge graph links FishEye has provided using visual analytics. Which sets are most reliable for completing the graph? Limit your response to 600 words and 6 images.\nIllustrate how your visual analytics approach can be used to identify new patterns and/or anomalies that are present in the knowledge graph after you have added the links you deemed reliable in question 2. Limit your response to 300 words and 4 images.\nIdentify companies that fit a pattern of illegal fishing. Use visualizations to support your conclusions and your confidence in them. Limit your response to 300 words and 4 images."

Additionally, we will explore networks between the top wholesalers and recipients using different hscodes to observe any variations in patterns among different product categories.\nCentrality of nodes & categorize business relationships:\nTo determine the relationship between companies, metrics such as degree centrality or eigenvector centrality will be computed to measure centrality scores. The scores can be visualized by changing the appearance of the nodes.\nTemporal Pattern Mining:\nBy observing shipping patterns over the same time period, we can then identify any abnormal relationships or patterns among these companies (e.g. companies who do not have any records for multiple years).\n\nThe following diagram is a proposed example of changing the appearance of the nodes based on centrality scores. The bigger the nodes, the higher the degree centrality score, while the darker the nodes, the higher the eigenvector centrality score."

As seen from the figure, cod2, lichen, salmon, shark and tuna bundles contain relatively fewer nodes compared to the other bundles, thus these bundles will not really value-add to our main network graph.

These abnormal connection patterns may include dense interconnections within a small group of companies, or isolated groups.\nAfter combining the links from the main network with those from the selected bundles, some original missing values can be filled. We will then reevaluate the network graph again to determine if there are companies with high weight but incomplete records for certain years. After identifying the companies with abnormal temporal pattern, we will then utilize interactive visualizations to analyze their data based on specific years or companies. This will allow us to examine how the network connections among these companies change over the years."
