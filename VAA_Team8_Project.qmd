# Visual Analytics and Applications - Team 8 Project

## Background:

The country of Oceanus has sought FishEye International's help in identifying companies possibly engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. As part of the collaboration, FishEye's analysts received import/export data for Oceanus' marine and fishing industries. However, Oceanus has informed FishEye that the data is incomplete. To facilitate their analysis, FishEye transformed the trade data into a knowledge graph. Using this knowledge graph, they hope to understand business relationships, including finding links that will help them stop IUU fishing and protect marine species that are affected by it. FishEye analysts found that node-link diagrams gave them a good high-level overview of the knowledge graph. However, they are now looking for visualizations that provide more detail about patterns for entities in the knowledge graph. There are two main parts to this analysis.

First, FishEye knows from past experience that companies caught fishing illegally will shut down but will then often start up again under a different name. FishEye wants your help to visualize temporal patterns so they can compare the activities of companies over time to determine if the companies have returned to their nefarious acts.

Second, FishEye has been using several tools, including artificial intelligence, to reason on the knowledge graph and suggest links that could extend the dataset. They have supplied 12 groups of link suggestions and need your help evaluating these groups to identify which tools are most reliable for completing the graph. FishEye is especially interested in identifying new temporal patterns or anomalies that are only present when new links are added.

## Objectives:

1.  Use visual analytics to identify temporal patterns for individual entities and between entities in the knowledge graph FishEye created from trade records. Categorize the types of business relationship patterns you find. Limit your response to 600 words and 6 images.

2.  Evaluate the sets of predicted knowledge graph links FishEye has provided using visual analytics. Which sets are most reliable for completing the graph? Limit your response to 600 words and 6 images.

3.  Illustrate how your visual analytics approach can be used to identify new patterns and/or anomalies that are present in the knowledge graph after you have added the links you deemed reliable in question 2. Limit your response to 300 words and 4 images.

4.  Identify companies that fit a pattern of illegal fishing. Use visualizations to support your conclusions and your confidence in them. Limit your response to 300 words and 4 images.

## **The Data**

The data sets were obtained from the [VAST Challenge 2023 website](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2023/MC2.html), and consists of a knowledge graph and 12 bundles.

The 12 bundles (namely carp, catfish, chub_mackerel, cod2, herring, lichen, mackerel, pollock, salmon, salmon_wgl, shark and tuna) are generated by FishEye International using an AI program, each consisting of link suggestions that can potentially be added to the main graph for additional information.

The knowledge graph and the 12 bundles each contain 2 data frames, namely \"nodes\" and \"links\".

### Node Attributes

| **Variable** | **Description**                                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Id           | Unique ID assigned to each fishing company                    |
| Shpcountry   | Country the company most often associated with when shipping  |
| Rcvcountry   | Country the company most often associated with when receiving |
| Dataset      | Always \"MC2\"                                                |

### Edge Attributes

| Variable         | Description                                                                     |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| arrivaldate      | Date the shipment arrived at port in YYYY-MM-DD format.                         |
| hscode           | Harmonized System code for the shipment.                                        |
| valueofgoods_omu | Customs-declared value of the total shipment, in Oceanus Monetary Units (OMU)   |
| Volumeteu        | The volume of the shipment in 'Twenty-foot equivalent units'.                   |
| weightkg         | The weight of the shipment in kilograms.                                        |
| dataset          | Always 'MC2'.                                                                   |
| type             | Always \"shipment\".                                                            |

## Methodology

1.  Data cleaning and wrangling

-   a\. Ensuring that the variables are formatted in the correct data type.

-   b\. Handling of missing values

-   c\. Transformation of variables (e.g. creation of new variables)

-   d\. Aggregation of edges

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis

-   a\. Check timeseries distribution of variables.

-   b\. Check hscode with most weights.

-   c\. Decide on filtering criteria.

3.  Building of the Shiny app

-   a\. Design website layout

-   b\. Build Shiny according to our analysis

4.  The following is a non-exhaustive list of R packages that will be used for this challenge:

-   \`shiny\`: for building interactive web applications

-   \`shinythemes\`: for customization of the Shiny app

-   \`jsonlite\`: for loading and reading of \".json\" files

-   \`tidyverse\`: a collection of R packages used for data preparation and manipulation

-    \`igraph\`: for network analysis and visualization

-   \`ggraph\`: an extension of ggplot2 for the creation of network graphs.

-   \`visNetwork\`: for creating interactive network graphs

-    \`lubridate\`: for working with dates and times

-    \`plotly\`: for generating interactive charts

## Approach

### Q1. Categorize the types of business relationship patterns

1.  Network Graph Building

2.  Centrality of nodes & categorize business relationships

3.  Temporal Pattern Mining

### Q2. Evaluating predicted knowledge graph provided by Fisheye

To determine the bundles that can be used to complete the main knowledge graph, we will plot facet nodes graphs for each bundle as below. Bundles that provide the most useful information will be selected.

### Q3. Finding new patterns/anomalies

The selected bundles will be combined into initial network, and new patterns would be explored base on that new network.

### Q4. Identifying suspicious companies by new patterns

After new patterns/anomalies are detected, suspicious companies would be identified.
